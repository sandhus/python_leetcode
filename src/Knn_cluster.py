"""
Your task is to write a Python function that implements the k-Means clustering algorithm. This function should take specific inputs and produce a list of final centroids. k-Means clustering is a method used to partition n points into k clusters. The goal is to group similar points together and represent each group by its center (called the centroid).
Function Inputs:

    points: A list of points, where each point is a tuple of coordinates (e.g., (x, y) for 2D points)
    k: An integer representing the number of clusters to form
    initial_centroids: A list of initial centroid points, each a tuple of coordinates
    max_iterations: An integer representing the maximum number of iterations to perform

Function Output:

A list of the final centroids of the clusters, where each centroid is rounded to the nearest fourth decimal.
